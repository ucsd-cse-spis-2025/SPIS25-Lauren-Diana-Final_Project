    <h1>About SPIS Stocks</h1>

    <section>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        SPIS Stocks is a web app designed to predict whether popular tech stocks will go <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN</strong>
        the next day using historical price data.
      </p>

      <h3>The Model</h3>
      <p>
        Our model is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) built with PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. 
        It uses six added features that come from stock data:
      </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>open-close</code>: difference between opening and closing prices.</li>
            <li><code>low-high</code>: difference between daily low and high prices.</li>
            <li><code>daily_return</code>: percentage change in closing price compared to previous day.</li>
            <li><code>is_quarter_end</code>: binary flag indicating if the date is at the end of a fiscal quarter.</li>
            <li><code>stock_id</code>: numeric identifier encoding the stock symbol.</li>
          </ul>
      <p>
        The MLP consists of three hidden layers with 128, 64, and 32 neurons respectively, using ReLU activations and dropout layers to help prevent overfitting.
        The model outputs a probability indicating whether a stock will go up (1) or down (0) the following day.
      </p>

      <h3>Data</h3>
      <p>
        We train our model on a combined dataset collected from Kaggle, featuring historical daily data from ten major stocks: Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Google, Meta, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Amazon, Samsung, and Netflix.
        Each dataset contains typical stock market columns like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that some datasets are a bit outdated and don’t reflect the most recent market activity, but they provide a solid foundation for training the model.
      </p>

      <h3>Predictions</h3>
      <p>
        Using the previous day's data, the model predicts if a stock’s closing price will move <strong>UP</strong> or <strong>DOWN</strong> that day.
        The output also includes a confidence score representing how sure the model is of its prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
        While our model performs slightly better than random chance, with an overall accuracy around 52%, it’s important to remember that stock markets are highly complex and influenced by many unpredictable factors.
